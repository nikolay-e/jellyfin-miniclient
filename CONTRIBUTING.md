This is a small project focused on building a minimal Jellyfin music client.

## Goals

- Bundle size <150KB gzipped
- Cross-platform (Web, Desktop via Tauri, Mobile via Capacitor)
- Clean, maintainable TypeScript/Svelte code

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally
5. Submit a PR

## Key Principles

- Keep it minimal - this is a "mini" client
- Performance matters - check bundle size impact
- Follow the design patterns in README.md
- Test against a real Jellyfin server
